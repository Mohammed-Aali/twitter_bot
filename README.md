# Twitter Bot
A Python script that generates and posts inspirational quotes on Twitter using three APIs: Ninja, Unsplash, and Tweepy.

## Installation
To run this project, you will need Python 3 and the following libraries and modules:

- Pillow: A Python imaging library that allows you to manipulate images.
- ColorThief: A Python module that extracts the dominant color from an image.
- Tweepy: A Python wrapper for the Twitter API that allows you to interact with Twitter.
- Pytest: A Python framework for testing your code and ensuring its quality and functionality.
- Requests: A Python module that allows you to send HTTP requests and handle the responses.

You can install all these dependencies by using the requirements.txt file that I have generated using pipreqs. Simply run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal and it will install all the required packages for you.

You will also need to obtain API keys from Ninja, Unsplash, and Twitter. You can find more information on how to do that on their respective websites:

- [Ninja](https://api-ninjas.com/): A free API that provides random quotes on various topics.
- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/): A free API that provides high-quality images on various topics.
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com): A social media platform that allows you to post tweets.

Once you have the API keys, you will need to create a file called `keys.py` in the same directory as your script and store them as variables. For example:

```python
# keys.py
NINJA_API_KEY = "your_ninja_api_key"
UNSPLASH_API_KEY = "your_unsplash_api_key"
TWITTER_API_KEY = "your_twitter_api_key"
TWITTER_API_SECRET = "your_twitter_api_secret"
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN = "your_twitter_access_token"
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = "your_twitter_access_token_secret"
```

## Usage
To run the script, simply execute `python project.py` in your terminal. The script will generate a quote and an image about a random topic. It will then overlay the quote on the image using the best color for contrast based on the image's luminosity. Finally, it will post the resulting image on Twitter using your credentials.

You can also run `pytest` in your terminal to test your code and check if it works as expected.

## Examples
Here are some examples of the tweets generated by this project:

You can also check out my Twitter account [@inspire_b0t](https://twitter.com/Inspire_b0t) where I post these tweets regularly.

## Motivation
I created this project as a way to practice my Python skills and learn how to use different APIs. I also wanted to create something fun and useful that could inspire people with positive messages. The cs50p provided the fundamental knowledge needed, and I am grateful for the efforts of the team.

## Challenges
Some of the challenges I faced while working on this project were:

- Finding reliable and free APIs that could provide quotes and images on various topics
- Handling errors and exceptions from the APIs
- Choosing the best color for the text based on the image's luminosity
- Formatting the text and image properly for Twitter

## Future Improvements
Some of the future improvements or features I plan to add are:

- Adding more customization options for the text and image (such as font, size, position, etc.)
